      <p>
      Did you ever choose not to be bothered by observing the evil around you, or maybe have grown tolerant to the same so that you do not even consider it as evil? Or did instant gratification grow on you, so much so that you lost sense of the goal you have to reach, sedated by the temporary pleasures it has to offer? Or did you ever get distracted or chose to ignore what you are supposed to do? Did you ever put your guard down, and face consequences by not staying alert? finally did you find your calling in life and are you being faithful to your calling of God and are you doing that with a zeal?. These are very tough and yet essestial questions one need to ask themselves sooner or later in life. By carefully pondering and asking these questions I got to know that I miserably failed and even so, writing this article I acknowledge that I am a weak man and I get carried away if I am not reliant on the mercies of God.
      </p>
</p>In all the above there is one precious thing we are loosing, you are right, it is time. God has entrusted us with time to fullfill His purposes in our lives, if we grow complacent in discovering and acting on them, there will come a time when the senses will become dulled to no point of recovery.<p>
</p><p>
   <h2>Knowing Your Calling</h2>   
</p>Personally, I wasted a lot of time, in not knowing what to do in life and have not enquired with God what His purposes were for my life. From my childhood when I got to know that scientists are well respected, I decided to become one, when I was in my 7th standard I developed interest in Web developing, so I thought I would become a web developer, then coming to know there are men of God like Billy Graham and Bakht Singh, you are right I thought I will become a famous preacher like them, but God took me to a totally different course, I was pounded, shaken to the core mentally, before coming to the Lord, to show me His purposes for my life. Not that I discovered everything but there is a goal that God gave me to focus on.<p>
      <b>I would say to everyone who is searching for love, that no human being can be with you, be it your own family at all times, look to Jesus, my one true love.</b>
